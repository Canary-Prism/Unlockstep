# Unlockstep

you know Lockstep? from Rhythm Heaven? this is that

to use: 
```sh
java -jar --enable-preview <the file>
```
you can optionally specify `--game`, `--music`, `--sprite`, and `--color` to be either `lockstep1` or `lockstep2`  
if you only specify some of them the rest will be determined by which makes most sense

### Download Steps

2. Find latest release
3. Find "Assets" Section

### Notice

This program uses Java 22 with preview features bc i'm weird like that
